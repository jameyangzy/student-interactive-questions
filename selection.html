    <p>1. Fill in the Brick Pyramid above according to the following rule:</p>
    <p><em>The number on each brick is the sum of the numbers on the two bricks it stands upon (except for the bottom row).</em></p>
    <p>2. How many solutions did you find? Could there be more? Explain.</p>
    <p>3. Create your own Brick Pyramid problem(s).</p>

    <p><strong>Please select one approach:</strong></p>

    <div class="option-container">
        <button class="option-btn" onclick="selectOption('A')">A: I prefer to try solving the problem directly by filling in different numbers and checking if they follow the pyramid rule.</button>
        <button class="option-btn" onclick="selectOption('B')">B: The 5-level pyramid seems too difficult, so I want to start with a simpler 3-level case to understand the basic concept first.</button>
