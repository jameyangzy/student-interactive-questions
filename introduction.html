    <h2>BRICK PYRAMID</h2>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jameyangzy/student-interactive-questions/main/img/Introducation.png" alt="Brick Pyramid">
    <p>1. Fill in the Brick Pyramid above according to the following rule:</p>
    <p><em>The number on each brick is the sum of the numbers on the two bricks it stands upon (except for the bottom row).</em></p>
    <p>2. How many solutions did you find? Could there be more? Explain.</p>
    <p>3. Create your own Brick Pyramid problem(s).</p>
    
    <p>In this lesson, we will explore how numbers in a structured pattern interact and how we can use logical reasoning to fill in missing values correctly.</p>
    <p><strong>A Brick Pyramid follows a simple rule:</strong> Each brick in the pyramid is the sum of the two bricks directly below it.</p>
    <p><strong>Our goal today</strong> is to apply this rule to complete the pyramid while thinking critically about possible solutions.</p>
    
    <h3>What We Will Do Today:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill in the missing values in the Brick Pyramid by applying the given rule.</li>
        <li>Determine the number of possible solutionsâ€”is there only one correct way to complete the pyramid, or are there multiple solutions?</li>
        <li>Create our own Brick Pyramid problem to challenge ourselves and others!</li>
    </ol>
